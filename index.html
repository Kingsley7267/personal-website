<p>Since the Movement Control Order (MCO) is enforced I have been thinking of how to go through the day as you are only required to stay at home and nobody can go out from your house yard.</p> 

<p>Of course, I believe everbody will feel bored at home so do I. So, I choose to gain my knowledge which is joining my mother doing donut's. Well, it is my first time doing it and I feel quite nervous </p>
    
<p>but I managed to handle my nervouse and obviously the outcome that I have produced quite impressive as you can see the picture above. Hence, if you want to have a try in doing donut</p> 

<p>you may search the ingredients from the internet and I have provide you a short video of tutorial in doing donuts.</p>
